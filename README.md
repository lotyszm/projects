Dive into the world of Liturgical Stores, my pride and joy as a developer. This project showcases my ability to create e-commerce platforms that speak in 7 different languages, hosted on servers spread across 4 countries. The technology behind it, including PrestaShop, PHP (Symfony), MySQL, JavaScript, SCSS CSS, and AWS Lightsail, forms a seamless backbone for a globally connected digital shopping experience. The integrations with dedicated systems and external services (stripe, paypal, inpost, GLS) highlight my skills in web development.
